# Learning to use Github and Codeanywhere
## **Starting Off**
This is a document that I will be using to perform more advanced functions with *github* and *codeanywhere,* so I'm going to describe a little of the process of learning these tools to add structure to the document.  
Beginning to use a *Linux* system was extremely strange to me. I thought that I was going to have much more difficulty attempting to understand what was happening!  
Really, I was just nervous because I thought that computers were much more complicated than they are.  
And I probably also thought I was going to need a much more extensive knowledge of their function than I do.  
After registering my accounts on both websites, **John Martin,** my instructor began to guide us through the confusion towards better learning and capability with the programs.  
Creating a repository and adding some simple documents from the interent were our first tasks... Piece of cake.  
## **Diving Deeper**  
Getting a little bit more in depth, John had us create a [blog](https://elliotjonathan94.github.io/) that we will be using throughout the semester to showcase our newfound abilities.  
Using a handy template tool known as **Jekyll** it was really a piece of cake. Using their [website](https://jekyllrb.com/) it gives specific instructions on how to setup the page through *github* and *codeanywhere.*  
Altering the content of the blog required a few more steps to be taken, namely:    
1. A functioning knowledge of the [markdown language](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) helped in the alteration of documents and allowing them to appear as a webpage.  
2. Functional operation of the [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) program allowed for the conversion of **markdown** language to other types of file formats.  
3. Finally, a strong knowledge of github terminal commands allows me to check my work, ensure that it operates properly, and save my changes to *github* from *codeanywhere*  
## **Where I am now**
Working with John over the past week, we have learned about **scripting** and working with .sh files.  
These files are a little different because they *communicate* with the user while it executes the function it was designed for.  
But, I'm still learning about that one...  
So ![here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Adler_jagt.jpg/1200px-Adler_jagt.jpg) is a sweet picture to end this thing off with.
