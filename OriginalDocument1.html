<h2 id="starting-off"><strong>Starting Off</strong></h2>
<p>This is a document that I will be using to perform more advanced functions with <em>github</em> and <em>codeanywhere,</em> so I'm going to describe a little of the process of learning these tools to add structure to the document.<br />Beginning to use a <em>Linux</em> system was extremely strange to me. I thought that I was going to have much more difficulty attempting to understand what was happening!<br />Really, I was just nervous because I thought that computers were much more complicated than they are.<br />And I probably also thought I was going to need a much more extensive knowledge of their function than I do.<br />After registering my accounts on both websites, <strong>John Martin,</strong> my instructor began to guide us through the confusion towards better learning and capability with the programs.<br />Creating a repository and adding some simple documents from the interent were our first tasks... Piece of cake.<br />## <strong>Diving Deeper</strong><br />Getting a little bit more in depth, John had us create a <a href="https://elliotjonathan94.github.io/">blog</a> that we will be using throughout the semester to showcase our newfound abilities.<br />Using a handy template tool known as <strong>Jekyll</strong> it was really a piece of cake. Using their <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">website</a> it gives specific instructions on how to setup the page through <em>github</em> and <em>codeanywhere.</em><br />Altering the content of the blog required a few more steps to be taken, namely:<br />1. A functioning knowledge of the <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">markdown language</a> helped in the alteration of documents and allowing them to appear as a webpage.<br />2. Functional operation of the <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> program allowed for the conversion of <strong>markdown</strong> language to other types of file formats.<br />3. Finally, a strong knowledge of github terminal commands allows me to check my work, ensure that it operates properly, and save my changes to <em>github</em> from <em>codeanywhere</em><br />## <strong>Where I am now</strong> Working with John over the past week, we have learned about <strong>scripting</strong> and working with .sh files.<br />These files are a little different because they <em>communicate</em> with the user while it executes the function it was designed for.<br />But, I'm still learning about that one...<br />So <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Adler_jagt.jpg/1200px-Adler_jagt.jpg" alt="here" /> is a sweet picture to end this thing off with.</p>
